## Overview

### The challenge

# :hammer: Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### :wrench: Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### :books: What I learned

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<svg>Learned some about svg :D</svg>
```
```css
/* CSS */
.a-basic-understanding-of {
  z-index: property;
  position: absolute;
  overflow: property;
  top: animations;
  transform: rotate(animations);
}

/* Discovered */

::placeholder {}
:nth-child() {}

@media queries

```
```js
// JavaScript
const learningThis = () => {
  console.log('Getting data from API')
  alert('Async functions')
  console.log('LocalStorage')
  alert('Copy to clipboard')
  const (e).currentTarget = (this) {}
}
```

### :computer: Continued development

I must continue searching for API to use on my future projects, such as studying more complex JavaScript concepts, using JSON would also be pretty good. I would also like to learn React JS.

### :open_file_folder: Useful resources

- [Menu "Hamburger" Icon Animations](https://codepen.io/designcouch/pen/ExvwPY) - Helped me make the mobile menu button.

- [Animating mobile menus using CSS](https://blog.logrocket.com/animating-mobile-menus-using-css/) - Also very useful for my menu. I might check those two again later.

- [How to copy to clipboard](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_copy_clipboard.asp) - W3Schools really helped me a lot in this project with most of my css and JS. Here is a page I looked to solve my problem with clipboard copying on mobile.

- [Window localStorage Property](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp) - Another W3Schools page, but this one helped me with the history functionality.

- [JavaScript Ternary Operator - Pi My Life Up](https://pimylifeup.com/javascript-ternary-operator/#:~:text=Finally%2C%20the%20ternary%20operator%20is,what%20we%20have%20shown%20below.) - A basic concept, but helpfull to make ma code cleaner in some parts.

- [javascript - JS remove last child? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34193751/js-remove-last-child ) - Stack Overflow was one resource I used the most for answering my doubts. This post helped me with the history limit function.

- [Introduction to web APIs-Learn web development | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction) - 
MDN was one of the most important JS and CSS concept resource I used in this project and on any other I make, along with W3Schools and Stack Overflow. Here is a article i read when learning how to use the API.

- [How to shorten a URL with vanilla JavaScript and the Shrtcode API | Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-shorten-a-url-with-vanilla-javascript-and-the-shrtcode-api/) - This one article enlightened the use of the shrtco.de API for me, when I was still stuck on it.

- [Como escrever um README incr√≠vel no seu GitHub | Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/artigos/escrever-bom-readme?gclid=CjwKCAjwq-WgBhBMEiwAzKSH6IlngHgjiSMSvVjOY-94OaeXbrp-_UNDNqqO-jfUh-a-jw_wT65iwhoCx90QAvD_BwE) - Thank you Alura for helping me know how to write a README, actually, that's the first one I wrote, and I want to continue improving on it!
